<p>We are excited to announce that our upgraded ORCID Certified Service Provider (CSP) program is now available to service providers with an ORCID integration! Certification is a free-of-charge service offered by ORCID for any integration that meets ORCID&#8217;s best practice-based criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the upgraded CSP program, ORCID provides an enhanced set of benefits to CSPs, including greater exposure to potential customers and users who seek reliable, consistent, and convenient solutions. CSPs also enjoy some benefits normally reserved exclusively for ORCID’s member organizations, such as expert consultation for integration project planning, testing resources, and dedicated tech support for troubleshooting—both during and after the certification process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-csps-are-catalysts-to-global-orcid-adoption">CSPs are catalysts to global ORCID adoption</h2>



<p>Service providers that have pre-built ORCID functionality in their products and services enable hundreds of ORCID members to gain value from their membership in the quickest, simplest way: by providing a means to easily integrate ORCID into their local workflows and systems and provide a more consistent user experience for researchers when they encounter ORCID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It might be no surprise to the reader that our member organizations, when reviewing and selecting new systems to meet their own business needs, frequently ask us which scholarly service providers have the best ORCID-enabled product functionalities. In order to be able to answer these questions objectively, and assure members that the ORCID integrations in services we recommend adhere to best practices, we introduced the first version of our Certified Service Provider (CSP) program in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improving-certification-criteria-based-on-best-practices">Improving certification criteria based on best practices</h2>



<p>What we learned from the early days of certifying service providers is that best practice in integrating with ORCID extends far beyond the basics of collecting ORCID IDs and connecting with ORCID records. In fact, in order to deliver the most value to its users, the optimal ORCID integration in a service is highly workflow specific. The new CSP program offers certification for integrations supporting the following workflows:</p>

<li><a href="https://info.qa.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/csp-criteria-manuscript-submission-systems/">Manuscript Submission Systems</a></li>



<li><a href="https://info.qa.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/csp-criteria-repository-systems/">Repository Systems</a>&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://info.qa.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/csp-criteria-research-information-systems/">Research Information Systems</a></li>
</ul>



<p>We drafted the revised certification criteria based on extensive analysis conducted on industry best practices for the most important workflows used by various scholarly service provider systems integrating with ORCID. In March 2023, we issued draft criteria for each of these workflows, inviting vendors, those responsible for reviewing and selecting vendor systems, workflow experts, users, and other interested members of the ORCID community to review and comment on the drafts. We then reviewed and integrated the comments and suggestions into the final criteria documents, which can be found here.</p>

<p>We believe that by providing clear, concise certification criteria via the CSP program, we can help service providers ensure that they are delivering the ORCID integration functionality that their customers expect and require.</p>



<p>If you provide services to the scholarly community which fit into one of the categories above, we invite you to get certified! It is free of charge and will help you to increase the visibility and trustworthiness of your products and services.</p>
