<p>ORCID’s Enabling Value series showcases how ORCID-certified service providers enable fast and simple registry interoperability for ORCID member organizations and other scholarly institutions. If you missed our most recent Enabling Value webinar featuring Erik Hanson, a system developer with <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">Public Knowledge Project</a> (PKP), you can <a href="https://vimeo.com/927983661?share=copy">watch the replay here</a>.</p>



<p>PKP is a research and development project that creates and supports open infrastructure to improve the quality, reach, and diversity of scholarly publishing. In this webinar, Hanson covered two of PKP’s open source ORCID-integrated products, Open Journal Systems (OJS) and Open Preprint Systems (OPS). ORCID is integrated within the editorial and workflow processes of both OJS and OPS, which allows users to validate users’ ORCID iDs as part of the publication process.</p>

<p>OJS is used to manage and facilitate all aspects of the scholarly publishing workflow, including the submission and review process, the selection of peer reviewers, assignment of due dates, and sending reminders to stay on schedule. Additionally, it allows users to manage all aspects of the production process, including substantive editing copy, editing, layout and galleries, and the collection of articles, editorials, and reviews into issues for publishing online in a mobile, friendly website. These features make it the world&#8217;s most widely used open source journal publishing software platform, available in over 50 languages.</p>



<p>Similarly, OPS is an open source preprint server software that allows researchers to upload data sets, revise papers before publications, and link the final published work. OPS users can invite scholars, and share preprints and research data, through an easy submission wizard. It also allows researchers to post frequent updates as they accumulate data. Finally, it allows for the distribution of preprints.</p>



<p>“As a <a href="https://info.orcid.org/upgraded-certified-service-provider-program-now-available/">pilot partner</a> for the revamped <a href="https://info.orcid.org/vendors-and-service-providers/become-an-orcid-certified-service-provider/">ORCID Certified Service Provider</a> (CSP) program, we were excited to work with PKP to recertify their ORCID integrations that were built for OJS and OPS to demonstrate a commitment to open research and ORCID’s ongoing mission,” said Shivendra Naidoo, ORCID’s Senior Engagement Lead. “We thank them for their continued support and for participating in this webinar to demonstrate how editors, publishers and institutions who use OJS or OPS can easily configure the ORCID integration, to maximize its benefit to authors and reviewers, as well as the wider research community.”</p>
